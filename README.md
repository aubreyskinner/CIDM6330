### Improving Vital Sign Documentation

#### Problem Description
As a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA), I record patient vitals (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation) in daily logs. 
As of now, this process is done by paper and pen in a very manual fashion. Here are some issues I experience with the current system:
* Running out of printed logs and having to print new ones
* Difficulty in tracking patient progress due to records being split up or lost
* Having to take photos of the printed logs so I can chart them at the end of the week. This creates a process prone to errors.
* Being unable to read handwritten numbers 

I want to create a system that can digitize and streamline the process of recording patient vitals. 

#### Domain of Practice
This problem resides within the **healthcare domain**, more specifically **medical record-keeping**. I rely on accurate and timely patient data and the current system is inefficient. 

#### Professional Interest
Through this job, I deal with these challenges daily, and improving the way vital signs are recorded would help me provide better care to patients, save time, reduce the risk of errors, and improve workplace efficiency. 

#### Proposed System
I propose to design a **mobile or web application** that helps:
* Record vital signs digitally
* Track and visualize patient progress with graphs or tables
* Minimize human error

Even small errors in vital sign tracking can lead to delayed or incorrect treatment. This is one reason why there is importance in systems that allow for modernized record keeping.
